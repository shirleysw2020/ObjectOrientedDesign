# ObjectOrientedDesign

###
Before I learned Object Oriented Programing, I would approach probelms in procedural programming.
However, when a program's magnitude complexity increases, OOP comes in handly to break down problems into smallerparts that we can reuse and separate out concerns.

We can translate our task at hand into a problem statement. And start picking up the nouns as objects, and verbs as operations or methods to execute on the obejcts.

Generally there's three steps in OOP:
- Identifying the components of the system or application that you want to build

- Analyzing and identifying patterns to determine what components are used repeatedly or share characteristics

- Classifying components based on similarities and differences

How I go about OOP:
brainstorm with UML diagrams to visualize relationships between actors and operations in a program
FWrite simple function signatures and classes which are shown in the rest of this repo.
